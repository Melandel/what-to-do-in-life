## Listing of Directions
> Provides guidance on what to do

* bar (social, 1x/week)
* friends (network, 1x/week)
* calisthenics (long term self-investment, 3x/week)
* vim (long term tooling, 1x/week)
* walking (healthy, everyday + 1x long walk (20km?)/week)

## Listing of Objectives
> Is done at some point, is useful or has a concrete output

* Clean
* Solve a puzzle
* Colorization

## Listing of Techniques
> Apply when recognizing situations

* When feeling low, have a default resourcing activity that can be done alone to distract mind positively

## People are not at my disposal
> Being in a situation of immediate distress does not justify that people who love me should make themselve available for me

* That's right. The path is to be walked alone - others may join for the duration they wish, but one cannot depend on them

## Direction (solo)
> Getting faster at things I already do does not seem to be the way, because it's lonely at the top and it gets repetitive. Perfection is a goal of efficiency, not personal growth.

What are things that make me feel happy that I can do on my own?
* Inspire (art)
* Experiment (increase pool of possible things to do)
* Show to others a taste that they don't know of (authenticity)

## Priorization
> Environmental habits(exercise, cleaning, papers) must go on first priority, even though they are the least important. It's infrastructure, not growth - but it is a pre-requisite for quality growth
