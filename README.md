## Listing of Directions

## Listing of Objectives
> Is done at some point, is useful or has a concrete output

* Clean
* Solve a puzzle
* Colorization

## Listing of Techniques
> Apply when recognizing situations

* When feeling low, have a default resourcing activity that can be done alone to distract mind positively

## People are not at my disposal
> Being in a situation of immediate distress does not justify that people who love me should make themselve available for me

* That's right. The path is to be walked alone - others may join for the duration they wish, but one cannot depend on them

## Direction (solo)
> Getting faster at things I already do does not seem to be the way, because it's lonely at the top and it gets repetitive. Perfection is a goal of efficiency, not personal growth.

What are things that make me feel happy that I can do on my own?
* Inspire (art)
* Experiment (increase pool of possible things to do)
* Show to others a taste that they don't know of (authenticity)

## Priorization
> Environmental habits(exercise, cleaning, papers) must go on first priority, even though they are the least important. It's infrastructure, not growth - but it is a pre-requisite for quality growth

## Unrequited love, Grieving, and the power of love
> To grieve deeply, is to have loved fully

* Renouncing the ones you have loved & craved enough, may transform unending craving into a special place in your kindness when you spend time alone

## Weekends
### Saturday: "break-your-limits" day
* walking, personal records, etc

### Sunday: "hindsight" day
* Prepare for the week (cooking/cleaning/etc)
* Explore/Push further in healthy lifelong habits (minimalism/exercise/etc)
* Explore/Push further in bonding ability (cooking/cocktails/reading/meeting/dancing/singing)
* Explore/Push further in daily life skills (software craftsmanship)

## Not feeling bad about the way you spend your time (there is always more productive!)
* video games great stress relief but not good growth path
* growth path more fulfilling when environmental socialization (diversity)
* 2 types of hobbies with socialization:
    * physical exercice
    * fun: "consume what's enjoyable" (pleasure of senses)
* "have a good time" can be distorted into "impress others/yourself by overcoming challenges/being the best (too much into self-improvement)
